1. there are email functions on Employees/attendance, Employees/timesheet, Sales/invoices, and All policies/structure.
they have to send mail with pdf attachment to the user email.
but now they don't send mail to user email(this is the email address in input field).

2. there is the function to register new employee on Employees/All Employees page.
  when register new employee on the Employees/All Employees page, the user doesn't appear in the list table, but it appears only searching with Full name.
and then, when register new employee as admin, the user has to see all data like dashbord page, Products/all products, inventory, Sales/invoices, etc.

user: gesadmin
pass: abcd1234

this is admin user info.
so when you register as admin, you have to get all permission as above user.

ps: you can check the similar function on Users page. there is also function to register new user.
the function works well, mean that when register new user as admin or client, the user can see all data as like above user.
